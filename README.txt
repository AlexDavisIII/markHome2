This is a project thought up by Mark Shelton! Essentially, this page will help become a staging area for wireframes, mockups, and a variety of other things to make sure things stay in order, neat, and better organized.

Things included in base file (first thing pushed to gitHub)
	- Menu Bar
	- Title area
	- An Image and arrow surrounding that image

Things currently included
	-Menu Bar (slides out when button on top left corner is clicked)
	-Title area (currently with placeholder "Title")
	-Image with arrows surrounding it that cycle through other images.

Area for the description of the page itself has been added!
