	<p>This is seriously just some sample text. Nothing in here is really going to stay (including this). So, image that there is some text here describing the site or something. Also, imagine that there may be an image over to the left side of the div. That would be kind of cool I think! Or maybe it would take away from the page. Only one way to find out, though! </p>
